# Photon-RGB
Simple Photon control of RGB strip lighting

Things you will need:
1. A Particle Photon/Spark Core
2  Some wire
3. WS2812B rgb (of course others neopixel styles can be used)
4. You may either need a breadboard or soldering iron (or both)


The great things about this is that the RGB strip light can run off of the VIN of the Photon/Core


For any project you will need a few items:

First you will need the smartthings device handler.
Next you will need the Photon firmware.  there are 3 files you need for this:
    The photon or kitchen .ino files
    The neopixel.cpp
    The neopixel.h
    
With these items in place you will just need to pair your photon to smartthings and you are good to go.
