# Photon-RGB
Simple Photon control of RGB strip lighting

Things you will need:
1. A Particle Photon/Spark Core
2  Some wire
3. WS2812B rgb (of course others neopixel styles can be used)
4. You may either need a breadboard or soldering iron (or both)


The great things about this is that the RGB strip light can run off of the VIN of the Photon/Core
